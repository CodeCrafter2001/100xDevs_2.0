This week’s assignments are organized into three main sections:

Middlewares:

Create standard middlewares for your application:

Middleware to log the number of requests on a server.

Middleware for rate-limiting user requests based on their username in the header.

Middleware to log the number of errors on a server.

To test your work, navigate to the 01-middlewares folder and run the command: npx jest ./tests

JWTs:

Write a function to generate a JWT token:

It should take a username and password as input and encode the username into a JWT.

Return null if the username isn’t a valid email or if the password is shorter than six characters (use the zod library for validation).

Write a function to check if a JWT can be decoded:

Input: A JWT.

Output: Return true if it can be decoded (not verified); return false otherwise.

Write a function to verify a JWT:

Input: A JWT.

Output: Return true if it can be verified; return false otherwise.

To test your work, go to the 02-jwt folder and run the command: npx jest ./tests
